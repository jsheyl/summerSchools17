**Instructor**: Schuyler Lindberg (UBC Library)

**Title**: Introduction to Harvesting API Data in Python from UBC Library's Open Collections

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: While this course is designed to be accessible to novice programmers, a basic
familiarity with Python is recommended. If you are new to Python, please take the time to review
[the free introductory lessons](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). A basic familiarity with Python
syntax, lists, and loops will allow you to get the most out of the course.

**Course plan**: This course is intended to cover the fundamentals for programmatically accessing and
harvesting data from open web APIs. It will provide an introduction to the key concepts required to
gather data from UBC Library's Open Collections API using Python. You will learn how to structure and
send basic GET and POST requests, and to receive and parse JSON responses.

- What is an API? A Brief Overview
    - Getting Started with the Open Collections API
    - Understanding JSON
- GETting item metadata
    - Get the metadata from one item (basic GET request)
    - Combining requests: Get metadata from multiple items
    - Analyzing Text data with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- POSTing a search request
    - Keyword Search
    - Filtered Search
    - Aggregate Search Queries (Faceting)
    - Visualize your results (time permitting)

**Setup requirements**: 

Please note that the setup requirements for this course have changed. We will no longer be using Jupyter notebooks.

You will need a laptop with Python 3.5+ installed and a text editor or IDE that you are comfortable using. 
Demonstrations will be given using PyCharm CE and this application is highly recommended to follow along. It can be downloaded for free at https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Please arrive early if you require assistance getting set up.
