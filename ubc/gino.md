**Instructor**: Gino DiLabio (Professor of Chemistry, UBC Okanagan)

**Title**: Application of Computational Chemistry Techniques using the Gaussian Program

Gaussian is one of the most widely used computational chemistry packages. This session will describe the
application of the Gaussian-16 package to problems of interest to Chemists. The use of the GaussView and
ChemCraft graphical user interfaces will also be discussed. Focus will be placed on the application of
density-functional theory (DFT) based methods, and some of their pitfalls.

Participants are encouraged to [contact the instructor Gino DiLabio](mailto:Gino.DiLabio@ubc.ca) prior to
the workshop with specific chemical problems of interest to them.

**Target audience**: anyone interested in using computational chemistry in their research

**Course plan**:
1. Introduction
1. GUI overview
1. Building molecules
1. Choosing an appropriate method
1. Running calculations efficiently
1. Analyzing and visualizing results

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner to intermediate

**Prerequisites**: Attendees should bring their laptops with MOABXTERM installed. Some exercises will be
provided. Participants are encouraged to contact the instructor a week before the start of the workshop
if they wish to provide specific problems of interest to them. If feasible, these will be discussed
during the workshop. (A "getting started" guide will be circulated to participants prior to the workshop
â€“ they are strongly encouraged to review the document and engage in some of the exercises contained
therein before the start of the workshop.)
