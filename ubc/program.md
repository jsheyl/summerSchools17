# WestGrid Research Computing Summer School - UBC

The school will take place from June 19 to June 22 at UBC main campus in Vancouver. Registration is
[now open](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/westgrid-research-computing-summer-school-ubc-tickets-33260995533).

## Schedule & Session Details

Morning sessions will be 9:00am-12:00pm. Afternoon sessions will be 1:00pm-4:00pm. All sessions will take
place in two rooms in the Pharmaceutical Sciences Building: a larger lecture theatre (room 1201) and a
smaller classroom (room 3208).

This page will continue to be updated as details are confirmed for room assignments, session times and
detailed course information.

**Important**: All attendees must bring their laptops and power cords (if your battery does not last
all day). Before the start of the summer school all eligible attendees must obtain:
1. their Compute Canada acounts. You can find detailed instructions
   [here](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account). Please
   note that you need only a CCDB account to log in to the new systems, so only Step 1 (and Step 3 for
   your supervisor) will need to be completed (but not Step 2).
  - if you are not eligible to apply for a WestGrid account (for non-academic attendees), we will provide
    a guest account for you
2. their Eduroam accounts through their home institutions. You will need online access to complete the
   hands-on exercises, log in to remote systems, view documentation, etc., so please make sure you can
   sign in to Eduroam. If not sure how to obtain it, please contact the local IT department at your
   institution.
