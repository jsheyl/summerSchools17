**Instructor**: Jeremy Heyl (UBC Physics and Astronomy)

**Title**: Physics and astrophysics modeling

Students will be introduced to the following three topics:

- Molecular Dynamics with LAMMPS
- Multiphysics Simulations with FLASH
- Stellar Evolution with MESA
  - bonus: how to make beautiful plots and optimize numerics

***LAMMPS (105 minutes)***

LAMMPS is a general purpose molecular dynamics simulator with applications from biology to astrophysics.  Please visit the page:

http://lammps.sandia.gov/

and install it on your computer so that we can do some experiments together using LAMMPS:

- How to set up experiments
- How to analyse the output
- How to change the underlying physics

Also install VMD ( http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD ) and ctioga2 ( http://ctioga2.sourceforge.net ).  I will also introduce ctioga2 that create beautiful plots for your presentations and publications.

You will divide up into groups to pick your experiments, run them, learn what they are doing and then present both your results and how your code works.

***LAMMPS Presentations (45 minutes)***

***FLASH (15 minutes)***

FLASH is a well-developed multi-physics hydrodynamics, magnetodynamics, radiative transfer code.  It includes adaptive mesh refinement and tons of physics.

I will outline the capabilities of FLASH.  You have to register to download it, so we won't have a hands on time.

***MESA (15 minutes)***

http://mesa.sourceforge.net

MESA is designed to simulate stars, so on the face it might not be generally interesting scientifically; however, it contains a state-of-the-art numerical analysis package that you could use for your code.

I will outline how to use MESA for stars and also how to use bits and pieces of it for your projects.
