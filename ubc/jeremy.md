**Instructor**: Jeremy Heyl (UBC Physics and Astronomy)

**Title**: Physics and astrophysics modeling

Students will be introduced to the following three topics:

- Molecular Dynamics with LAMMPS
- Multiphysics Simulations with FLASH
- Stellar Evolution with MESA
  - bonus: how to make beautiful plots and optimize numerics

***LAMMPS (2 hours) ***

LAMMPS is a general purpose molecular dynamics simulator with applications from biology to astrophysics.  Please visit the page:

http://lammps.sandia.gov/

and install on your computer so that we can do some experiments together using LAMMPS:

- How to set up experiments
- How to analyse the output
- How to change the underlying physics

***FLASH (15 minutes) ***

FLASH is a well-developed multi-physics hydrodynamics, magnetodynamics, radiative transfer code.  It includes adaptive mesh refinement and tons of physics.

I will outline the capabilities of FLASH.  You have to register to download it, so we won't have a hands on time.

***MESA (45 minutes)***

MESA is designed to simulate stars, so on the face it might not be generally interesting scientifically; however, it contains a state-of-the-art numerical analysis package that you could use for your code.

I will outline how to use MESA for stars and also how to use bits and pieces of it for your projects.   I will also introduce Tioga and ctioga2 that create absolutely beautiful plots for your presentations and publications.

**Duration**: 3 hours
